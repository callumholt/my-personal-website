                    <p id="">I love solving problems. I have always loved tinkering with technology when I was younger, 
                        from pulling apart computers and working out how to put them back together again, 
                        to building my first robot from scratch including programming the software on an arduino 
                        microcontroller to achieve a set task autonomously
                    </p>

                        At school, i earned a scholoship to study an honors Bachelor program in Mechanical Engineering. 
                        After 2 years of studying engineering, I loved working on projects and building solutions to problems in a team, 
                        however I could see there was a big gap between the engineering side of problem solving and the connection with the end customer.
                        This lead down a customer centered pathway, where i've focused the last 5 years on learning sales, customer service, 
                        account management, leadership and management skills and operations.

                        During this time, i've learnt alot about customers, about business and about solving problems and now its time to bring that back into my 
                        engineering in the form of joining a team and solving real problems for customers with high quality software solutions.
